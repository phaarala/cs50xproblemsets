// Implement a program that calculates the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text. 
// Your program should print as output “Grade X” where “X” is the grade level computed, rounded to the nearest integer. 
// If the grade level is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output “Grade 16+” instead of giving the exact index number. 
// If the grade level is less than 1, your program should output “Before Grade 1”.

// index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8 (L = average number of letters per word and S = average number of sentences per 100 words
